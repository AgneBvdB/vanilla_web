# Gallery website


## What and Why

This is a portfolio website for artist.
My goal is to create a fast, elegant, responsive painting gallery site using minimal technologies.
And to practice clean design, data-driven rendering, and manual layout logic.


## Features

- A responsive navigation bar with page links
- Dynamically rendered gallery
- A modal (hidden by default) that will display full-size paintings

## How to Use/Run it

Open index.html in your browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Project Status

In development â€” initial structure and layout complete

### Next steps

1. HTML Structure
Design a simple semantic layout:

A header with navigation links.

A main section that will contain the dynamically rendered gallery.

A modal (hidden by default) that will display full-size paintings

2. Styling with CSS

Apply consistent spacing, font styles, and image behavior.

Add media queries to ensure it looks good on all screen sizes.


Include hover effects and smooth transitions for polish.

## 3. JavaScript Logic
Convert jpg to webp 2019 and up
upload to array 2018 and up

Add a close button to dismiss the modal.

4. Responsiveness and Testing
Test the site on different screen sizes and devices.

Improve accessibility: alt tags, keyboard close for modal, focus traps if needed.

Check performance and mobile loading speed.

Add lazy-loading for all images to optimize speed.

5. Deployment

Upload your code to GitHub and deploy the site using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Set a proper meta description, favicon, and open graph tags for sharing.

## Future improvements

Filter or sort by year without refreshing the page.

Add a search bar for titles or techniques.

Dark mode toggle.

Smooth scrolling navigation.

Keyboard navigation for the modal view (e.g. arrow keys).
