# Gallery website


## What and Why

This is a portfolio website for artist.
My goal is to create a fast, elegant, responsive painting gallery site using minimal technologies.
And to practice clean design, data-driven rendering, and manual layout logic.


## Features

- A responsive navigation bar with page links
- Dynamically rendered gallery
- Dynamically rendered info page
- A modal (hidden by default) that will display full-size paintings
- Dynamically rendered inqury form.

## Project Status

In development â€” Gallery is rendering, infopage loading and rendering.

### Next steps

1. Implement filter function for gallery
2. Create inquiry form in the infopage "buy" button
